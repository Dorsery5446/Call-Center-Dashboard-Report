## Project Requirements
The Call Center Overview of the Company captured some Key Performance Indexes (KPI), which are:
1.  Total Number of calls: We need to track and display the total number of calls received by our call center over a specified period.
2.	Total Call Duration in Hours: It is crucial to understand the total amount of time our call center staff spends on calls in hours, which can help       us in resource allocation and capacity planning.
